# URLCoordinates

Manually creating a new map for my "Maps" Repo became very time consuming.
I was manually extracting a locations street views latitude and longitude.

I thought there must be an much quicker way.

So I created this script to accept a google maps url, and extract
the latitude and longitude, and export the coordinates to a JSON file.
